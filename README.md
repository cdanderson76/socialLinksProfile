<h1>This is my solution for the Frontend Mentor Social Links Profile Project</h1>

This is a small project in which I had built out a social link-sharing profile. I've personalized it to share all of my social profiles.  Clicking on any of the links will take you to the associated profile and social media app.

<h2>What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?</h2>

With this project, I am most proud that I was able to get this to look appealing across all of my devices. The hover animations look fairly smooth, and I tried to add my own spin to the project by attempting to use slightly different shades of color. I also used a color change animation for my footer.

<h2>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?</h2>

One challenge that I faced was trying to use a gradient for my profile card color. Because my links are in it's own div, I couldn't really figure out how to get it to blend in with the color of the profile card (some lines wouldn't merge with the lines in the container, so it made it look strange). As a result, I just decided to go with solid shades on this project.

Another problem that I always tend to have in the beginning is centering the project on the page. I think I've gotten better with it, but it's always something that I get stuck on longer than I'd like. To overcome this, I usually just make the make the parent container a flex container, and center the content using the 'justify-content' and 'align-items' properties.

<h2>What specific areas of your project would you like help with?<h2>

I don't think that there is anything that I needed help with, but tips and comments are always useful. I don't think I had too many issues putting this project together, but feedback is always good...
